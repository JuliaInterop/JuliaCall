## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

## Reverse dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of JuliaCall
(https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep).
The summary generated by revdepcheck is at (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/README.md)
and (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/problems.md).
There are 7 downstream dependencies currently -- BayesFluxR, bigsimr, diffeqr, iai, RTIGER, sMTL, and knitr. We checked these 7 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 2 (new) problems. 1 note with diffeqr, and 1 error, 1 warning and 1 note from knitr, which are all unrelated to JuliaCall package.

Issues with CRAN packages are summarised below.

### New problems
(This reports the first line of each new failure)

* diffeqr
  checking installed package size ... NOTE

* knitr
  checking running R code from vignettes ...
  checking package dependencies ... WARNING
